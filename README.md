# BackgroundWork: Android Background Processing Playground

This project serves as a comprehensive playground for exploring various background processing components in Android development. It demonstrates the implementation and usage of Services, Foreground Services, WorkManager, BroadcastReceiver, and AlarmManager.

## 🚀 Features

- **Services**: Explore basic background operations
- **Foreground Services**: Implement long-running background tasks with user visibility
- **WorkManager**: Schedule deferrable, guaranteed background work

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Minimum SDK: API 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop)
- Target SDK: API 33 (Android 13)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thearchetypee/BackgroundWork.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Sync Gradle and run the app on an emulator or physical device

## 📚 Usage

Each component is implemented in its own module or package. Navigate through the codebase to explore different implementations:

- `/app/src/main/java/com/example/backgroundwork/services/`
- `/app/src/main/java/com/example/backgroundwork/workmanager/`
- `/app/src/main/java/com/example/backgroundwork/broadcastreceiver/`
- `/app/src/main/java/com/example/backgroundwork/alarmmanager/`
